        <h2>Here is some stuff about me:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I like to draw in my free time. I'm hoping I'll become a better artist eventually.</li>

            <li>I took a game design class in high school.</li>
            
            <li>I used Ubuntu on my laptop for a while, but I uninstalled it when I came to CodeStack academy.</li>
            
            <li>The Nintendo DS and 3DS were my favorite childhood consoles. I played several of the Virtual Console games (Which were games from older consoles like the NES or the Game Boy), and I also enjoyed retro-styled indie games.</li>
            
            <li>I took some classes at Delta college a little while before coming to CodeStack.</li>
            
            <li>I don't really use social media very much.</li>
