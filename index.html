        <h2>Here is some stuff about me:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>I like to draw in my free time. I'm hoping I'll become a better artist eventually.</li>

            <li>I took a game design class in high school. We used the Unreal Engine and used blueprints rather than actual code. I haven't really done much game design since then.</li>
            
            <li>I used Ubuntu on my laptop for a while, but I uninstalled it when I came to CodeStack academy. I might consider installing another Linux-based OS sometime in the future, though.</li>
            
            <li>The Nintendo DS and 3DS were my favorite childhood consoles. I played several of the Virtual Console games (Which were games from older consoles like the NES or the Game Boy running on an emulator on the 3DS), and I also enjoyed retro-styled indie games.</li>
            
            <li>I've learned html and css in the past, though since it's been a while since then, I'm glad to be relearning it in this class.</li>
            
            <li>I prefer single-player games to online games.</li>
        </ul>
